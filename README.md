# 🏙️ Mayor Ben — Game Concept Render

Welcome to the very first **public concept render** of the game I’m building — a city simulation called `Mayor Ben`.

This `.app` is a **demo** build that showcases the *early guts* of my procedural voxel and polygon rendering experiments. It’s not a game yet — it’s the bones of something bigger.

## 🚀 How to Run It (macOS)

1. **Download** the `.zip` from the [⬇️ Download the Demo](https://github.com/benscanlan/Mayor_Ben_Game_Concept_Render/releases/latest)
2. **Unzip** the file  
3. **Right click > Open** `Mayor_Ben_Game_Concept_Render.app`  
4. If macOS complains: go to **System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway**

💡 This is a Terminal-based demo — expect text output, not flashy graphics (yet).

## 📦 What This Is

- A small glimpse into my **assetless pipeline**
- Renders basic polygon or voxel data
- Terminal-focused — runs fast on MacBooks
- No DRM, no installer, no signup. Just *pure dev energy*.

## 🧪 Current Features

- Procedural asset sketching
- Lightweight `.app` bundle
- Early-stage logic powering future buildings

## ❗ Disclaimer

This is not a finished game. This is **a work in progress**, shared in the spirit of openness and solo indie development. There may be crashes, weird output, or nothing at all. But it’s **real** and it’s **live**.

## 📅 Demo Expiration

This version may stop running after a set date in the future (dev decision). Don’t wait. Play now.

Built with ❤️ on macOS, fueled by coffee, rejection, and a little bit of **rage against the game dev machine**.
